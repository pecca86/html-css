# WEB DESIGN

## Why is it important?
- It is the first thing that the user sees

## Typography
- The art of creating readable and appealing text
- Serif = small lines at the end of the letters
- Sans-serif = no small lines at the end of the letters
- "Normal" text is usually between 16px and 32px
- 65 - 72 characters per line is a good rule of thumb
- line height of 1.5 - 2 is a good rule of thumb
- Ususally, don't justify text

## Color
- Choose a main and a secondary color, optionally a third color for accents
- Choose colors that are easy to read and have constrast (13:1 vs 2.9:1)

## Images
- Use images that are relevant to the content
- Product, Illustration, pattern, background, story-telling, etc.
- Place the text in a neutral area of the image
- Darken or brigtent the image to make the text more readable
- Use images that are high quality
- High resolution screens are becoming more common, so use high resolution images (twice as big as the size they will be displayed at)
- Use images that are optimized for the web (smaller file size)

## Icons
- Use icons that are relevant to the content
- Use SVG icons when possible
- Use icons to provide visual cues
- Use icons to save space
- Use icons to make the content more appealing
- Use icons to associate actions with the content

## Shadows
- Can help show relationships between elements
- Give a sense of depth
- Don't use too dark shadows
- Small shadows for small elements we want to draw attention to (CTA buttons, etc.)
- Pop-ups can have large shadows

## Border radius
- Can impact on the overall look and feel of the website

## Whitespace
- Can help draw attention to elements
- Can help make the design look more clean and polished
- We can add alot of whitespace between sections
- Whitespace can be used instead of lines to separate sections

## Visual Hierachy
- Use size, color, contrast, whitespace, etc. to create a visual hierarchy
- Which elements are more important than others?
- Can define a path for the user to follow

## UX
- UX is experience with design
- The webpage exists for a reason and the user has a goal -> we want to help the user achieve that goal
- Feedback to the user (in forms etc.)
- Highlight the active element
- Highlight CTAs or other important elements
- Place CTA button in logical places
