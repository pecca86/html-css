      <p class="introduction">
        At some point I will add more stuff, such as forms, images, videos etc.
        to the page. The end goal is to use SASS for structuring the CSS in a
        better way. For CSS I will also use the BEM approach for semantic and
        functional naming of classes.
      </p>
      <p class="introduction">
        The page will also include some Javascript and I am aiming to make it as
        responsive as possible for different screen sizes. <br />
        Below is a list with links to different pages, where I try out different
        things. It also includes a description of technologies used.
